        In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose,
        comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the
        implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is a divide and
        conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.[1] A detailed description and analysis of
        bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948

        Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

        Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
        Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be
         the sorted list.

        Mergesort guarantees to sort an array of N items in time proportional to N log N, no matter what the input.
        Its prime disadvantage is that it uses extra space proportional to N.
