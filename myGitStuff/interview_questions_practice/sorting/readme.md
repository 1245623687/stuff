These are just some conceptual notes to myself to help me remember the differences between the different types of sorts.


The simplest sorts are insertion sort and selection sort. They are nice and easy and suitable for small sets.


The difference between insertion sort and selection sort is that insertion sort just keeps on grabbing the next item on the edge of the frontier and spindling it down to where it belongs, while selection sort searches everything past the edge of the frontier every time and then tacks it onto the edge of the frontier.
