### Personal Notes and Observations:
There is for CC Adobe Photoshop 2017, a plugin SDK, and a "cOnnection" sdk. From the description this feature seems like some cloud based thing that I couldmaybe be interested in, perhaps for mobile development, but for now I suppose I should just worry about old fashioned plugins.

There are 7 types of plugin modules. The type of plugin I am interested in writing is a Filter type plugin.

I am finding the Stack Renderer option rather interesting. It is for creating a Smart OBject. I do have my reservations though, because I suspect people hate these.

The Selection Option I also find rather appealing. Even in community college when I was 19 I understood the importance of pixel selection in image manipulation.

The more I read about this Selection Plugin thing the more I like it.
I open the Selectorama project and it seems to compile with no issue. 
One thing I notice is that there is no "Release" congifuration. I will need to figure out how to make that.

another todo: I will need to separate 32 bit and 64 bit builds, by adjusting the project properties, 

I am able to copy the plugin into the right place and get a basic selection plugin working. I need more resources to get started on my masking selection plugin so I put this initiative on hold for now.
