In order to compute the difference between two images we utilize the Structural Similarity Index, first inro by Wang et al in 2004 paper, Image Quality Assessment: From Error Visibility to Structural Similarity

This method is already implemented in the sci-kit image library for image processing.

Another good site with some useful theory on it: 
https://www.learnopencv.com/opencv-threshold-python-cpp/
I like this page because it also shows a c++ implementation side by side with the python implementation

the parent child hierarchy of contours

So what exactly is a contour anyway?
