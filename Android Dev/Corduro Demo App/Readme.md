Hello there.  This is the work in progress Corduro Demo app.  

This is open source and meant to demonstrate a possible way to use the Corduro PayMobile SDK for Android.

You might be looking at this if you are trying to figure out how to use our SDK.

The .aar file where the Corduro SDK would be has been removed because that code needs to be obfuscated, but feel free to look around.

More documentation coming soon...
