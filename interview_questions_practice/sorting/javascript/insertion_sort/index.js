 Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is
 much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However,
 insertion sort provides several advantages:
 Simple implementation: Bentley shows a three-line C version, and a five-line optimized version
 Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms
 More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n2)) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble
 sort
 Adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is O(nk) when each
  element in the input is no more than k places away from its sorted position
 Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
 In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
 Online; i.e., can sort a list as it receives it
 When people manually sort cards in a bridge hand, most use a method that is similar to insertion sort
