I fork the repo: 

https://github.com/senko/python-video-converter

I build all the stuff, but the automated tests are failing somewhere and I don't understand what the output means. I'm suspicious that it has something to do with ffmpeg. 

I do sudo apt install ffmpeg, and the tests still fail. I decide at this point that I need to actually do a little more research into ffmpeg anyway.
