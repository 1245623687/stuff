All video codecs use data compression, of which there are two kinds. Lossless, and lossy.

CinemaDNG is probably the most widely supported lossless video format. Cinema DNG (Digital Negative) is a format designed by Adobe and is comparable to shooting in Raw. Users seems disappointed that the format is not as open as Adobe had claimed it would be. It's a container, which is a set of raw images, accompanied by audio and metadata. The image stream can be stored useing frame-based wrapping in an MXF file, 

DNG is Adobes proprietary standard that was created to store image data in a generic highly compatible format, unlike RAW files that have specific formats based on manufacturer and camera type. It seems like the DNG format fell out of favor in the industry at some point at least for high end professionals.
