I clean large amounts of video. By cleaning I mean have to visually inspect the frames with my own actual eyeballs because the qualities that are needed in some particular dataset are difficult to detect via code, or it would take so long to code this that it's faster to do this visually with human eyes.

As to whether this is truly faster depends on the size of the dataset. 

Deleting a frame means I have to look for it in the finder or windows explorer and then I have to go right click delete, or clieck the delete button, and just the act of finding the file just takes too long. 

This gui will let me select a folder and pan though the images quickly using arrow keys and quickly press D for deleting the current frame, and r, begin, endframe, to delete a range of frames, 

this application doesn't really do all that much and I am hoping that I can make it relatively quickly.
