### Some prereqs: 

Note: using pip and using sudo pip are not interchangable. Using sudo pip can summon a diferent pip than regular old pip :) Don't use sudo. Also make your own env for doing these tensorlayer projects so you can throw away the env if you happen to screw it up.

pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-image

you can check the installed packages with pip list't 

so now let's get to what we're here for: 
pip install tensorlayer

apt-get install python-tk

pip install easydict
