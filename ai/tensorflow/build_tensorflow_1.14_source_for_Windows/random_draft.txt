 Install Bazel. I was hesitant to start using Bazel because I saw many examples using CMake, and because it was intimidating at first. However, I will say that the Bazel documentation is very good and the command line tools and syntax from Bazel are very well made, so there is no need to be scared of trying the new framework. 

The step to install Bazel are very well documented, so I will not include them in this document. You can follow them here: ``https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-windows.html``
Note: I Just downloaded the bazel exe file from Github. I built tensorflow from source, but I did not need to build Bazel from source. 

Fortunately, Bazel is pretty mature, if you have the wrong version of Bazel, it will warn you like this:

### Random Extra Shit
This page: ``https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#linux`` has a lot of useful links on it, but it is not what you need. It is about building Tensorflow from source for Python, (you want C++), and it is only tested on Linux and Mac, as shown in the screencap below.
![Not Tested and Not Supported for Windows](not_tested_and_supported_for_Windows.png)

According to the Tensorflow website as of 10/12/2019, this configuration is not tested and is not supported. However, I was able to build tensorflow on Windows using Bazel with GPU support and I will detail my endeavor in a level of detail that I hope is not too excruciating below. 

### A little background. 
We do machine learning stuff where I work. Normally we do machine learning stuff with tensorflow and the way we usually do this is we will build and train the neural net using Python.

Then, we want to convert this neural net into a product consumable by users, so we need to put it into a format accessible to the average person. Most people do not have Python installed, and most people do not use Linux as their operating system, but this is teh environment that seems to work best with Tensorflow. 

So what happens next is pretty much that we start converting all the Python code to C++, and we have to build an application to load the model on Windows, and another one that will build the model on the Mac. 

### First failed Attempt:
Since we have to build for both Mac and Windows, an easy thing to do in this situaiton is to use some cross platform framework like Qt so that you only have to write your code once. 

We tried getting some prebuild dlls and dylibs for tensorflow 1.14 and linking them into our project. We kept getting compiler errors about missing headers and unresolved external symbols no matter what we tried, so we determined that we might need more control, and decided to build Tensorflow ourselves. If you build the code yourself, you can find the exact line of code causing the missing header error or unresolved external symbol error and get what info you need to fix it.

The first thing you're going to see on that page is this: 
It's talking about Pip and Python a lot I suppose because most people end up building that instead of C++. This made me think I was in the wrong place at first, but you need to read through this to understand if your machine will work for the job so don't run away. 

The blue part with the star links to the prebuilt binaries. This was what we tried first and is usually the easiest way to go about using third party libraries in our C++ code. The reason it did not work for us I will explain in more detail later, but basically those libraries are not built with all their symbols exposed due to limitations on the number of symbols that can be loaded by the C++ linker. That is why we had to build from source, in your case you may be here for the same reason or others. 

The next thing you will see is this: 
![Install Python TF dependencies](install_python_and_tf_deps.png)
You can safely ignore this part because you are not here to build tensorflow in Python, you are here to build it in C++ on Windows, but don't leave, you will need other stuff in this article.

The next thing you will see is this:

It is tempting to go in order and just click that link and go ahead and install Bazel, but remember what you are here to do, you need to build Tensorflow with GPU support, so, actually, keep scrolling down, 
Click the first link, it's going to take you to ``https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-windows.html`` on the Bazel Website.
