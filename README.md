[Android Dev](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/Android%20Dev): a place where I put some little practice projects for reference for my Android Dev.
	[GoogleCloudMessagingQuickStartExampleApp](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/Android%20Dev/GoogleCloudMessagingQuickStartExampleApp/google-services): nothing to see here really, I've just added comments for my own personal reference to this demo project
	[PlayingWithBroadcastReceivers](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/Android%20Dev/PlayingWithBroadcastReceivers): well commented, I guess useful for understanding the use of Broadcast receivers, which you will need to know to use Google Cloud Messaging services
	
[Messing With wxPython](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/Messing%20With%20wxPython): wxPython is a neat little toolkit for making quick and dirty natives GUIs in Python. 
	[simpletexteditor](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/blob/master/Messing%20With%20wxPython/simpletexteditor.py): little text editor. todo: add drag and drop feature
	
[Projects for StackOverflow Questions](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/Projects%20for%20StackOverflow%20Questions/C%2B%2B/check_a_value_like_define_VERSION_3.1.4_at_compile_time): if I make a project to develop some code to answer a stackOverflow question, I archive it here for future reference.
	[check_a_value_like_define_VERSION_3.1.4_at_compile_time](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/Projects%20for%20StackOverflow%20Questions/C%2B%2B/check_a_value_like_define_VERSION_3.1.4_at_compile_time): a workaround required because of a limitation of the preprocessor commands in C++
	
[School - Comp Sci](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/School%20-%20Comp%20Sci): code written for classes. A lot of code in here. :/	
	[Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/School%20-%20Comp%20Sci/Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures): not the most code intensive class to be fair
		[CountsBinary1sInInteger.java](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/blob/master/School%20-%20Comp%20Sci/Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures/CountsBinary1sInInteger.java): not sure when this would even be necessary in Java, nonetheless, it counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of an integer.  todo: run this and make sure the iterative and recursive answers are not different somehow, 
		
		[Artificial Intelligence Spring 2015](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/School%20-%20Comp%20Sci/Artificial%20Intelligence%20Spring%202015): an excellent class taught by Vincent Nguyen at UTD. Take at your own risk, it is certainly not a blow off class, but Dr. Nguyen is a most excellent teacher.
		[Basic Search](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/School%20-%20Comp%20Sci/Artificial%20Intelligence%20Spring%202015/Assn%201%20-%20Basic%20Search): many problems can solved as search problems.  This program solves a simple puzzle problem using best first search, depth first search, uniform cost search, greedy search, and a star search. todo: add some metrics and analysis stuff for making the comparison of the search techniques understandable. Written in Python.
	
		[Backtracking Search](https://github.com/sitting-duck/stuff/tree/master/School%20-%20Comp%20Sci/Artificial%20Intelligence%20Spring%202015/Assn%202%20-%20Backtracking%20Search): a more sophisticated search technique than the previous, used to solve a constraint satisfaction problem. Written in Python. More description on that page. todo: perhaps add a visual component showing the tree as it is generated, add some more explanation on the purpose of the different heuristics todo: write the documentation for this one.
