# Short Summary: 
# 	Sets the install names of the dynamic library dependencies of an executable

# Some Background:
# 	This script exists because of the way dylibs work and the fact that we have external dylibs linking at runtime to our app.
# 	Every dylib has a string called it's 'install name'. Every dylib will also have a list of rpaths.
# 	When we link with a 3rd party lib, we have to set the install name and rpaths 
# 	ourself because there is no possible way the the third party devs could know how our project is set up.  

# 	This script is included in the build process because the install names on dylibs can get messed up sometimes.  
# 	Sometimes when transferring between computers, if the path to a dependency was not made relative using @rpath or, 
# 	what I have decided to do, @loader_path, the dependency can't be found at run time.  As well, I will say sometimes the
# 	finder appears to do things under the hood that I am not aware of and has messed up my dylibs before. I think it may be 
# 	resetting the owner of the dylibs, but nonetheless, I have found the only safe way to move them is using
# 	the terminal. This point of failure means any unknowing dev could mess them up quite easily, and probably will, so this
# 	script being in the build process means that they can always just build a new .app if they messed up one by digging around
# 	in the .app file.


# 	So let's talk about dylibs again.  The install name is the path to where the dylib itself is.

# 	The install name is an rpath.  
# 	An rpath, is a runtime search path.
# 	A runtime search path, is added to a list of runtime search paths, that the application executable will 
# 	use to find it's dependencies.  
# 	The dylibs install name is a path to the dylib itself.
# 	You can set it with the -id tag using the install_name_tool



# 	This can get rather complicated because dependencies can have dependencies, which can have depencies of dependencies,
# 	so, a wise thing to do might be to put all your dependencies in the same folder so that you can set all the rpaths to
# 	point to the same directory and you don't have to worry about being clever.

# 	So, a dylib will have an install name, as well as a list of rpaths to it's dependencies.  This script sets those
# 	rpaths using install_name_tool -change.

# 	otool -L is returns the child depencies of any dylib.
